					<h2>The Subject of This Lab</h2>
					<p>We are being made familiar with the directory and files within  Art 101. We were made to link the labs on our homepage so it opened to the htmls in said labs. We also added our picture to the homepage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
					<p>My code began to turn red and telling me there was a pronblem but when I checked on the the website once I had saved and edited, everything seemed normal and how I wanted it to look. I forgot how to indent properly as well. </p>
			</div>


			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Now I have a webpage that is linked from my homepage.We edited the html for Lab 3 and added answers to the boxes. We then put a screenshot of our file structure/directory.
