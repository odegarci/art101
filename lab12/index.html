			<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We are making conditionals for this lab by creating a Sorting Hat. Except , we are not using Harry Potter Houses because the mold has not infected me yet like it did to J.K Rowling.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Had some difficulty deciding what to do and I tried to mash up diffrent methods but it made the code not work or show up. The console was not allowing me to see any mistakes for some reason .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Try it out yourself. Type your name and then click on the dandelion in order to find out what<b> Pixie Hollow Fairy Talent</b> you were born with. </p>
