					<h2>Making Black Milk Tea with Boba</h2>

					<ol>
						<li>Gather all ingredients:  1/2 lbs bag of dry tapioca pearls, 1/2 lbs bag of loose leaf black tea, brown sugar, 1/4 lbs powder creamer, and water </li>
						<li>Boil an entire pot of water at medium heat </li>
						<li>Once it starts boiling, add your bag of dried tapioca pearls</li>
						<li>Stir the boba pearls  every 10 minutes for 30 minutes to make sure the boba balls don't stick to the bottom of the pot</li>
						<li>Once the 30 minutes are up, pour the pot over a large strainer and rinse the boba balls with cold water</li>
						<li>In a separate large container, add 1.5 cups of cold water and a one cup of brown sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
						<li>Add the boba pearls into the container with the brown sugar syrup we made. Stir to incorporate into the balls.</li>
						<li> Set aside the boba pearls. In another large pot, fill 3/4 of the pot with water and let it boil.</li>
						<li>Once the water starts to boil, add entire bag of loose black tea leaves into pot</li>
						<li>Cover the pot with the lid and make sure the heat is on a medium setting. Wait 10 minutes.</li>
						<li>After 10 minutes turn off the heat, let it set for 5 more minutes.</li>
						<li>Scoop out the tea leaves as soon as 5 minutes are up to prevent tea from turning bitter.</li>
						<li>Add ice until contents in the pot reach the top. Stir ice so it melts inside tea.</li>
						<li>Pour the tea into a separate larger pot.</li>
						<li>Add 24 oz of powder creamer into tea and stir thoroughly</li>
						<li>Add one scoop of boba pearls from our mixture into a cup. Then add desired amount of ice into it.</li>
						<li>Add desired amount of tea into cup followed by desired amount of sugar into it.</li>
						<li>Stir drink until fully incorporated</li>
						<li>Add a fat boba straw into drink and sip.</li>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<pre><code>
						//Create 2 rows x 2 columns of solid squares. With the variable 1 placed inside each square. 
						//Make the top row of squares pink, and the bottom row of squares purple. 
						//Bottom row of squares corresponds to Player 1, top row is for Player 2.  
						//Each square represents a hand.
						//Player 1 starts the game by clicking on one of their “hands.” 
						//Accept user input after every move/click. 
						//After the hand is selected, Player 1 is allowed to click one of their opponent’s “hands.” 
						//The variable value in Player 1’s hand adds to the variable number of the hand of Player 2 that Player 1 selected. 
						//The number in Player 2’s square changes once the move is completed. Player 1’s stays unchanged. 
						//Turn is changed to Player 2
						//Now it is Player 2’s turn to select one of their own “hands”
						//Add the amount present in the selected “hand”  to any of Player 1’s “hands” by selecting which “hand” they want to add to.
						//Each player takes turns making moves.
						//If both a Player’s hands add to an even number, the total amount can be equally split between the two hands.”
						//Splitting can occur when the Player selects both of their boxes. 
						//Splitting counts as the Player’s move for that turn. 
						//Each “hand” limit is 5. Once the “hand” reaches 5, it resets to 0. 
						//Once a Player’s “hands” both reach a value of  0, they lose. Their opponent wins. Game is over. 
						//Game resets back to 4 squares, each having the default number 1, until Player 1 starts the game again.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Pseudocoding was a bit difficult because the specificity of certain things was hard. I tried to compare what we did to the pseudocodig example but it looked like actual coding and the instructyuion told us to not try programming.We took forever trying to make sure that the code fit inside the division of the "Challenge" box and that took a while. Then addng the lists as instructed was confusing because the instructions at first were to just add the lists to the html. At the end it said to put them in results but they were already in the html as directed beforehand. I wish the instruction to where exactly to put the lists in the html were earlier on in the instructions.  </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>For all lists, see the sections above. We made a  pseudocoded list for how to make boba and another pseudocode in Java that we presented in the html under the "Challenges" heading. </p>
