  //Create 2 rows x 2 columns of solid squares. With the variable 1 placed inside each square. 
  //Make the top row of squares pink, and the bottom row of squares purple. 
  //Bottom row of squares corresponds to Player 1, top row is for Player 2.  
  //Each square represents a hand.
  //Player 1 starts the game by clicking on one of their “hands.” 
  //Accept user input after every move/click. 
  //After the hand is selected, Player 1 is allowed to click one of their opponent’s “hands.” 
  //The variable value in Player 1’s hand adds to the variable number of the hand of Player 2 that Player 1 selected. 
  //The number in Player 2’s square changes once the move is completed. Player 1’s stays unchanged. 
  //Turn is changed to Player 2
  //Now it is Player 2’s turn to select one of their own “hands” and add the amount present to any of Player 1’s “hands” by selecting which “hand” they want to add to.
  //Each player takes turns making moves.
  //If both a Player’s hands add to an even number, the total amount can be equally split between the two hands.”
  //Splitting can occur when the Player selects both of their boxes. 
  //Splitting counts as the Player’s move for that turn. 
  //Each “hand” limit is 5. Once the “hand” reaches 5, it resets to 0. 
  //Once a Player’s “hands” both reach a value of  0, they lose. Their opponent wins. Game is over. 
  //Game resets back to 4 squares, each having the default number 1, until Player 1 starts the game again.
