			<h1> Odette's Lame Corner </h1>
			<p> My partner Meryl and I worked on this project together. We luckily both live in the same city so we are able to work together in person. We found out today that we actually went to the same elementary school and middle school. I had actually met her in high school.</p>

					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>In this assignment, we were just confused on what we needed to do. We know we needed to edit the HTML and the CSS code but some of the stuff were already downloaded and didnt need to be done. Luckily, Ilia verified with us we just needed to edit this website.   </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Honestly, this assignment went pretty good. My partner and I got to work together at a cafe and we helped each other out if we were confused on anything. We did that issues with formatting, but luckily we could just refer back to the lecture in case we forgot anything.</p>
